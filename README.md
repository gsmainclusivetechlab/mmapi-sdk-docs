### What is the MMAPI SDK?

The GSMA MMAPI SDKs provides separate use cases to handle necessary MMAPI functionality including Merchant Payments, Disbursements, International Transfers, P2P Transfers, Recurring Payments, Account Linking, Bill Payments and Agent Services (including Cash-In and Cash-Out). Each use case exposes use case scenarios to customize your application integrations as needed. The SDK also includes samples, so you can test interactions before integration, which defines use cases to communicate with the Mobile Money providers.
